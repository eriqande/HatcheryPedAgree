# HatcheryPedAgree

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of HatcheryPedAgree is to automate the process of running
SNPPIT on large multi-generational hatchery data sets, and compare the
results of different runs, especially between runs that use meta data
(like sex and spawn date) and those that don’t.

## Installation

Within R, make sure you have the ‘remotes’ package and then do:

``` r
remotes::install_github("eriqande/HatcheryPedAgree")
```

## Example

Look in the `too_big_vignettes` directory for some examples.

#' Find matching samples to a single representative
#'
#' Given a specification of pairs of genotypes that must be from the
#' same individual, this identifies connected components and returns a tibble
#' with one column, `indiv`, and another column, `aliases` which is a list column, that
#' includes, for each `indiv`, all the other names it is known by.
#'
#' @param genotypes A longform tibble like coho_genotypes that has the columns `indiv`, `locus`,
#' `gene_copy`, and `allele_int` Missing data in the allele_int column must be denoted by NA.
#' @param return_cluster Set to TRUE by default, but you might not want
#' to do this if you have a very permissive cutoff.  It makes a graph of
#' the pairs and finds the connected components.
#' @param ... parameters to be passed to rubias::close_matching_samples.
#' Intended to be used for `min_frac_non_miss` and `min_frac_matching`
#' @return Returns a list with three components as follows:
#' * `pairs`: A tibble holding the matching pairs that were found.  It has
#'   the following columns:
#'     * `num_non_miss`: number of loci missing in neither member of the pair
#'     * `num_match`: number of non-missing loci having the same genotype in
#'       in each member of the pair.
#'     * `indiv_1`: the ID of the first member of the pair.
#'     * `indiv_2`: the ID of the second member of the pair.
#' * `clusters`: The groups of matching samples
#' * `aliases`: The alternatitive id's within a cluster

#' @examples
#' # There are not actually any matching samples in coho_genotypes
#' # but we will just create some pairs that match by cranking
#' # the min_frac_matching down to 80%
#' find_matching_samples(coho_genotypes, min_frac_matching = 0.80)

#' Relabel matching genotypes to a single ID and reorganize their years and spawner groups
#'
#' If there are matching samples, we want to make sure that we have just a single
#' ID for each cluster, and that the years and spawner groups get organized
#' so that SNPPIT can read all that information in.
#' @param genotypes the genotypes
#' @param metadata the metadata
#' @param clusters the tibble with the matching sample clusters.
#' @return A list with a variety of components:
#' * `matchers_metadata`: a tibble of all the matching sample clusters and their metadata
#' * `snppit_meta`: a tibble of metadata in long format that is preped for use in [prepare_snppit_infile()]
#' * `snppit_genos`: a tibble of genotype data in long format that is preped for use in [prepare_snppit_infile()]
#' * `cross_hatchery_matches`: a tibble of matching samples that were spawned at more than one hatchery
#' * `cross_sex_matches`: a tibble of matching samples that are marked as both sexes
#' * `geno_discord`: a list like that returned in [count_discrepancies()].
